# TODO

- Write and run tests
- code coverage setup
- Write docs

- t0 exoplanets, schedtel etc should use timezones
- Change requirements.txt, setup.cfg, and .readthedocs.yml to handle dev and doc cases specifically
- readme md -> rst, unification with docs
- synchronize scripts that parse an observatory keyword with a single function (schedtel, plot_schedule_gantt, exoplanet_transits, rst), ensure not initializing observatory
- html_observing_conditions replace pycurl
- Unify directory + filename conventions across collect_calibration_set, ccd_calib, calib_images, and syncfiles
- Handle API defaults for all scripts
- Calibration file names with filters should know names
- Recursively search for latest calibration set in calib_images
- calib_images should select dark with nearest exposure time to science image in ccd case
- tqdm for potentially long operations
- verbosity option should be a counter with multiple levels, use more logging levels in scripts
- Unify logging format across scripts
- images variables renamed to fnames
- Consistent order of options and arguments
- Initialize astroplan.Observer inside of Observatory object, remove redudant functions
- os.path.join everywhere
- Support for $TELHOME environment variable in all scripts
- io module for .sch files, unify utstart and other keyword readings
- Docs with types should be links to Python documentation (eg use "`str`" instead of str)
- fitslist should return an astropy Table, unify with summary_report code
- Scripts requiring observatory should have ability to manually input values retrieved from the observatory cfg file
- For scripts that save a file, allow input to be a directory but then use the default naming convention
- summary_report should have an option to hide the summary table
- summary_report should generate plots
- script to synthesize a generate and summarize a list of summary reports

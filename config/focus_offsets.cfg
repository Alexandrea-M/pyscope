# This Python dictionary maps a filter index to a focus value. 
# Focus positions can be expressed in absolute or relative units.
# The important part is that the *difference* between any two filter
# measurements is an accurate offset that can be used when moving 
# from one filter to the other.
# Note that it may not be valid to mix best-focus values that were
# measured at significantly different times or temperatures since
# the overall focus of the instrument may have changed.

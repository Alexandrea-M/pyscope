To onstall AstroImagej_3.0.tar.gz in /usr/local.

As root --

cd /usr/local
tar xvzf AstroImageJ_3.0.tar.gz

Then copy the astroimage shell script to /usr/local/bin/ to make AIJ 
available system-wide.

This  is a Linux Bash shell script to start AstroImageJ from the command line. 
You can change the name of the script to something even simpler like "aij" if 
you prefer or add a soft links such as 

ln -s astroimagej AstroImagej
ln -s astroimagej aij


The script reserves 8 GB of memory so that AIJ can work with long stacks of
large images.  If that more or less  memory is  available, change 
the line for a different footprint.  For example,

java -Xmx8192m -jar /usr/local/AstroImageJ/ij.jar
     xxxxxxxxx
     
would become

java -Xmx1024m -jar /usr/local/AstroImageJ/ij.jar
     xxxxxxxxx

with 1 GB of memory reserved.

AIJ will work with JDK7 and has been tested on Linux using OpenSuse 13.1


It is usually helpful for at least one user to be able to update AIJ 
using the update utility.  To enable this, make the 
/usr/local/AstroImageJ directory tree owned by that user:

cd /usr/local
chown -R username.user AstroImageJ

Alternatively, AstroImageJ can be installed as a user space program to 
be used only by that user.  To do this, untar the source code in $HOME 
for that user, and put the shell script in that user's $HOME/bin.   The 
linux OS has to have $HOME/bin in the user's path which you can check 
with "echo $PATH".    Edit the shell script's first line to be 

cd /$HOME/AstroImageJ

When java executes it must see the current working directory as the one 
in which you have installed the AstroImageJ source code.  AIJ will save 
the current data directory in its preferences and when you start it a 
second time it will show you the data file directory you used last.
